# Module-5

This is the final course work module of the Masters program. The three main courses learnt include:
1. Bayesian Statistics 
2. Predictive and Optimization Analytics 
3. Text and Unstructure Data Analytics 

Text and Unstructured Data Analytics course entailed understanding the natural language basics, the syntax, semantics, process and understanding the text with tokenization and normalization, Text classification, text summarization and information extraction and finally text similarities and classification through topic modelling. At the end of the course, we were required to scrape data and analyse it and ensure that we write a paper on it on our findings. 
My Term paper entail Crisis Management using sentiment Analysis: Effects of Ukraine war on the Kenyan Economy. 

Predictive and Optimization Analytics entailed developing actionable plans from existing corporate date, and initiatives to increase sales, reduce marketing costs and improve customer retention, through selecting, preparing, constructing, integrating, structuring and formating data to be most effective to ensure  the predictive model meets business goals. Some of the learning topics, included, sampling techniques, data structure and life cycle, business strategies, regression and time series prediction models, stochastic optimization and portfolio analysis. 

Bayesian Statistics entailed, on understanding the traditional methods used and the current statistical methods that are implemented, i.e frequentists vs bayesian modelling techniques. the lecture, further introduce using different methods with Winbugs, where we were to calculate ANOVA with winbugs, posterior means, and variances through incorporating prior density with both poisson and gamma, and finally understanding monte carlo simulation, the MC errors techniques and inverse transfer methods.
